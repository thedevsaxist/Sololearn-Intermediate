A key part of object-oriented programming is encapsulating, which involves packaging of related
variables and functions into a single easy-to-use object -- an instance of a class.
A related concept is data hiding, which states that implementation details of a class should be hidden,
and a clean standard interface be presented for those who want to use the class.
In other programming languages, this is usually done with private methods and attributes, 
which block external access to certain methods and attributes in a class.

The Python philosophy is slightly different. It is often stated as "we are all consenting adults here" meaning
that you shouldn't put arbitrary restrictions on parts of a class. Hence there are no ways of enforcing that a method 
or attribute be strictly private.

However, there are ways to discourage people from accessing parts of a class, such as by
denoting that it is an implementation detail, and should be used at their own risk.
