As we have seen in the previous lessons, Python supports the following collection types:
*List*, *Dictionaries*, *Tuples*, *Sets*.

When to use dictionaries:
>> When you need a logical association between a *key*:*value* pair.
>> When you need fast lookup for your data, based on a custom key.
>> When your data is constantly being modified. Remember, dictionaries are mutable.

When to use the other types:
>> Use *lists* if you have a collection of data that does not need random access. Try to choose lists when you need a simple, iterable collection that is modified frequently.
>> Use a *set* if you need uniqueness for the elements.
>> Use *tuples* when your data cannot/should not change.

Many times a *tuple* is used in combination with a *dictionary*, for example, a *tuple* might represent a *key*, because it is immutable.
